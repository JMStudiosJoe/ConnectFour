**Prerequisites**
npm: 5.4.2
node: 6.5
**Installation**
1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`
3. Open browser, preferably Google Chrome to localhost:8080

**Connect 4 with Vue**
Docs are spread out between v1 and v2 v1.vuejs.org and vuejs.org/v2/ plus already differences in syntax it seems


**Thought process**
- [x] 1. Get a basic Vue app to compile with Webpack
- [x] 2. Serve the compiled Webpack
- [x] 3. Connect first component
- [x] 4. Create board component with initial board
- [x] 5. Add disk to a row for player one
- [x] 6. Add disk to a row for player two
- [x] 7. if row is full then not able to add to row
- [ ] 8. Create winning game logic
    - [ ] a. Checking on disk insert and from the disk, out
    - [ ] b. check left hold row col++
    - [ ] b. check right hold row col--    I think I just realised this won't work will need to check entire board.
